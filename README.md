##Project Overview
SillySpeed Me! is an app designed to allow the user to list a bike for sale and favorite a bike they'd like to buy. The target audience is those who love to race cyclocross, particularly on a singlespeed (aka, a SillySpeed) bike!.

## Database

The database contains 2 tables:
* users
* billboards

[ERD diagram](TBD)

#Planning
I took a decent amount of time thinking about my models and how they related before I started building the backend. Once a structure was determined, I consulted many individuals to confirm that my models and rationale was sound.

This project was a great first step for revisting what I have learned with RoR.

## Next Steps
- Going forward, I'd love to add more models for different design scenarios and more in-depth structure for the models in general.
