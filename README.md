# Rev(n) Backend
Ruby on Rails backend for Rev(n) App
* [Front end repository](https://github.com/resource11/rev_n_frontend/tree/gh-pages)
* [Deployed site](http://resource11.github.io/rev_n_frontend)
* [Deployed backend](https://stormy-oasis-7808.herokuapp.com/)

##Project Overview
Rev(n) is an app designed to shorten the design/development iteration cycles that occur when clients and agencies partner on high-budget deliverables, i.e., large format digital displays in the high-traffic consumer space.

## Database

The database contains 2 tables:
* users
* billboards

#Planning
I took a decent amount of time thinking about my models and how they related before I started building the backend. Once a structure was determined, I consulted many individuals to confirm that my models and rationale was sound.

This project was a great first step for revisting what I have learned with RoR.

## Next Steps
- Going forward, I'd love to add more models for different design scenarios and more in-depth structure for the models in general.
